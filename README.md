# Algorithms
Code implementation for algorithms and Data structure using C# and TypeScript.

Used specifications : 

1- For C# implementations :

       To enable C# Apps on VSCode, I did the following : 
            
          1- Download and install C# extensions from VSCode            

          2- Download/Install The SDK : https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started-with-dotnet-tutorial#macose 
          
          3- If any errors related to CLI tools installation, kindly repair : Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable (x64) - 12.0.30501              
          4- Restart you machine. 
          
          5- Open the directory where you pulled the specific algorithm's implementation from my repository and open it with VSCode
          
          6- run dotnet build then dotnet run.
